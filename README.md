# smoothie-gcode
Scripts, tools and experiments for dealing with the Smoothieware implementation of gcode in GRBL mode

This repo is entirely focused on using Smoothieware on a Smoothie board (or the MKS Sbase, which
cannot be mentioned on the Smoothieware forums). Specifically, it is for using Smoothie with a
CNC setup (not for 3D printing).
